# Classes-and-Objects-in-C-plus-plus

## Aim:

To study and implement Classes and Objects in C++.

## Theory:

C++ is an object oriented programming language that allows the use of classes and objects to model real world entities.

A **class** is a user-defined data type that acts as a blueprint for creating objects. It groups data members(variables) and member functions (methods) into a single unit.

An **object** is an instance of a class. Each object has it's own copy of the data members defined in the class, but all objects can use the same member functions. Objects allow interaction with the class's data through well defined interfaces(methods).

### Key Concepts:

**1. Class** :

- Defined using the class keyword.

- Contains data members (variables that hold data) and member functions (which operate on the data)
